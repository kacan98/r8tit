## Overview
This app, developed using Angular, Ionic, C#, and SQL, is designed for supermarket enthusiasts. It allows users to explore, remember, and rate supermarkets they visit.
I developed it for me and my girlfriend, because we love to visit supermarkets.

## Features
- **User Authentication**: Secure login and user-friendly registration process.
- **Supermarket Logging**: Automatically detects and logs the address of supermarkets based on user's coordinates.
- **Photo Uploads**: Users can add pictures of each supermarket.
- **Ratings and Reviews**: Users can rate supermarkets and view ratings from others.

## Development
- The app's UI was designed using Figma. I created the prototype, which can be played to understand the user flow.

- **Running the App**:
  - Frontend: Run `npm install` followed by `npm run` in the 'frontend' folder.
  - Backend: Use `dotnet run` in the 'backend' folder to start the server.

## Future Plans
- A link to the deployed application will be provided once it's available.

> Note: This README will be updated with the links to the Figma prototype and the live application as they become available.
